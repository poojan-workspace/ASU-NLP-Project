# ASU-NLP-Project

## Statement: According to my dietary needs which dining hall at my university correlate with my reviews. 
## The significance of the topic derives out from absence of a suitable recommendation mechanism and menu display.

### Process and Project Results: 
We started by building our personal dataset, which comprised characteristics made up of four different sorts of meals. Following that, the database we have created was submitted to analyze the data and clean. Then, based on diet limitations, we created a dining menu layout with vegan, non-vegetarian, or vegetarian options. Using tableau, we further included cost columns and filtering choices to the display option. The menu presentation has indeed been incorporated on certain ASU locations, such as Polytechnic, Downtown and Tempe, to suggest meals depending on the proximity of dining areas. The purpose of our research is to develop an on-campus diet menu suggestion system that will allow ASU students to select whatever they want to consume in the dining areas.
